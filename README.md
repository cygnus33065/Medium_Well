This application takes inspiration from the website https://medium.com/. Our spin on the site, named **Medium Well**, features a variety of stories for users to read. Users can create an account to access the full features of the site. Our application allows authorized users to like/unlike stories, comment on stories, sort stories by category, and follow other users in order to see the content they've liked. To fully explore our site please visit https://medium-well.herokuapp.com/. All project planning was done on https://github.com/ via Wiki and can be viewed here: https://github.com/cygnus33065/Medium_Well/wiki. Our project planning process included creating a database schema, a feature list, user stories, and outlining frontend routes.

**The technologies our team used to build this application include:**

_RSS Feed:_ used to seed our application with preexisting stories
_Sequelize/PSQL:_ used to build our database and seed the tables with inputted data
_Node.js:_ allowed us to write and implement Javascript and build our application using Express
_Express:_ used as the server framework of our application
_Javascript:_ used to write front-end routes for each page/action in our application
_.pug:_ used to outline the structure of our application
_CSS:_ used to style pages and elements on our application

- challenges faced and the way the team solved them

A major challenge our team faced while building this application was the implementing the use of AJAX to update our likes and comments without rerendering the entire page. While ultimately we were unsuccessful in acheiving this goal of ours, it certainly taught us valuable lessons along the way. We discovered that from the start our databases had not been set up in a way that made these implementations simple to include. As a result, we did our best to write code to implement these features without the use of AJAX. Though it was dissapointing that we could not solve this issue, we decided our ultimate goal was to have a polished and presentable application by the end of the week, and we acheived this.
